    "text": "Introduction\nThe 22nd of March 2024 marked 50 years since work began to construct the Itchen Bridge (Robertson 1976; Nicholson and Robertson 1977). The bridge opened to traffic just over three years later on the 1st of June 1977.\nFigure 1 shows drone footage of the bridge in April 2024. The Itchen Bridge Maintenance Project also sees major repairs being undertaken this year.\nIn Section 3 we present photographs from 11 colour 35 mm slides from an unknown local photographer from Southampton who captured the construction process from 1974 to the final day of the Woolston chain ferry on the 11th of June 1977. Where possible have compared his images to the present day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Itchen Bridge, April 2024, Drone footage by Jeremy Hayes.\n\n\n\nAt 1200 metres in length and rising to over 24 metres at it’s highest point, the Itchen Bridge is by far the biggest bridge in Southampton (Figure 4).\nThe bridge replaced the Woolston Ferry some 144 years after a bridge was first proposed in 1833 and the history prior to the building of the bridge are well documented on the Itchen Bridge Wikipedia and Woolston Floating Bridge Wikipedia pages.\nSouthampton Museums & Archive have a page about the floating bridge as part of their Southampton Stories collection. On YouTube you can hear the song the Woolston Ferry by Gutta Percher & Balladeers which references the Lowry painting of the ferry that is part of the collection at Southampton City Art Gallery.\nBrian Adams wrote a book about the history and construction of the bridge (Figure 2) which is available in both the Southampton City and University of Southampton Libraries (Adams 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Missing Link by Brian Adams\n\n\n\nFor more technical details, the University of Southampton Library has two academic journal articles about the construction in its collection (Robertson 1976; Nicholson and Robertson 1977) together with lots of other local history in the Cope collection and Special Collections and Archives. As well as books and texts, these collections include postcards, maps and engravings.\nThe Daily Echo has published numerous articles about the Itchen Bridge in the last 50 years, including ‘10 things you may not know’ and ‘46 years on’ and this little tidbit about G E Prince & Sons from Chapel Road and the origins of the Toll Booths.\nThe bridge also inspired Ali Sparks to write the Radio 4 drama Tess of the Tollbooth."
