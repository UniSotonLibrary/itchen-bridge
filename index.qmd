## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

The 22nd of March 2024 marked 50 years since work began to construct the Itchen Bridge [@robertson1976; @nicholson1977]. The bridge opened to traffic just over three years later on the 1st of June 1977.

@fig-drone shows drone footage of the bridge in April 2024. The [Itchen Bridge Maintenance Project](https://transport.southampton.gov.uk/tcf/bursledon-to-southampton-corridor/itchen-bridge-maintenance-project/) also sees major repairs being undertaken this year.

In @sec-colour-images-then-and-now we present photographs from 11 colour 35 mm slides from an unknown local photographer from Southampton who captured the construction process from 1974 to the final day of the Woolston chain ferry on the 11th of June 1977. Where possible have compared his images to the present day.

At 1200 metres in length and rising to over 24 metres at it's highest point, the Itchen Bridge is by far the biggest bridge in Southampton (@fig-bridge-elevation).

The bridge replaced the Woolston Ferry some 144 years after a bridge was first proposed in 1833 and the history prior to the building of the bridge are well documented on the [Itchen Bridge Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itchen_Bridge) and [Woolston Floating Bridge Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolston_Floating_Bridge) pages.

Southampton Museums & Archive have a page about [the floating bridge](https://southamptonstories.co.uk/story/floating-bridge/) as part of their [Southampton Stories](https://southamptonstories.co.uk/) collection. On YouTube you can hear the song the Woolston Ferry by [Gutta Percher & Balladeers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OemLggeF8PU) which references [the Lowry painting of the ferry](https://southamptoncityartgallery.com/object/sotag-1483/) that is part of the collection at Southampton City Art Gallery.

Brian Adams wrote a book about the history and construction of the bridge (@fig-missing-link) which is available in both the Southampton City and University of Southampton Libraries [@adams1977].

For more technical details, the University of Southampton Library has two academic journal articles about the construction in its collection [@robertson1976; @nicholson1977] together with lots of other local history in the [Cope collection](https://library.soton.ac.uk/cope) and [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/archives/). As well as books and texts, these collections include postcards, maps and engravings.

The Daily Echo has published numerous articles about the Itchen Bridge in the last 50 years, including ['10 things you may not know'](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/24061133.10-things-may-not-know-southamptons-itchen-bridge/) and ['46 years on'](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/23559206.southampton-itchen-bridge-opened-46-years-ago-today/) and this little tidbit about [G E Prince & Sons from Chapel Road](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/yoursay/letters/10135618.memories-of-itchen-bridge-construction/) and the origins of the Toll Booths.

The bridge also inspired Ali Sparks to write the Radio 4 drama [Tess of the Tollbooth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001tj0q).
