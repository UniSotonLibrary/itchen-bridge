The images that appear on this page along with additional drone videos are available on the<br>[University of Southampton Library Digital Viewer](https://viewer.soton.ac.uk/collections/itchen-bridge-project).
:::

The 22nd of March 2024 marked 50 years since work began to construct the Itchen Bridge [@robertson1976; @nicholson1977]. The bridge opened to traffic just over three years later on the 1st of June 1977.

@fig-drone shows drone footage of the bridge in April 2024. The [Itchen Bridge Maintenance Project](https://transport.southampton.gov.uk/tcf/bursledon-to-southampton-corridor/itchen-bridge-maintenance-project/) also sees major repairs being undertaken this year.

In @sec-colour-images-then-and-now we present photographs from eleven colour 35 mm slides from an unknown local photographer from Southampton who captured the construction process from 1974 to the final day of the Woolston chain ferry on the 11th of June 1977. For five of the pictures we have compared the slides to the present day.

## Background

### Location {#sec-location}

The Itchen Bridge is located on the south eastern side of Southampton where the river is about 300 metres wide and a mile upstream from where the rivers Itchen and Test meet to form Southampton Water. @fig-map shows the site of the Itchen Bridge in relation to existing and planned infrastructure, including the then unbuilt M27 between Southampton and Portsmouth. The next nearest road bridge is the Northam Bridge, 2.5 miles further upstream.

![The Itchen bridge site in relation to the road system [@nicholson1977].](img/Nicholson-and-Robertson-Itchen-Bridge-Map-1977.jpg){#fig-map fig-alt="Map from 1977 of the Itchen bridge site in relation to the road system." fig-align="center" width="581"}

### Dimensions {#sec-dimensions}

At 1200 metres in length and rising to provide 24.38 metres clearance at it's highest point (28.9 metres above chart datum [@pung]) and weighing in at 61,000 tons [@adams1977], the Itchen Bridge is by far the biggest bridge in Southampton (@fig-bridge-elevation). The height is a result of two ship mast height surveys carried out in 1958 and 1970. Only six ships with masts greater than 24.4 metres were observed in 1970, but this was sufficient to not apply for any reduction in height as laid out in the 1960 Southampton Corporation Act. This in turn created the 5% gradient that makes the bridge rise steeply from the land on either side [@robertson1976].

![A diagram of the Itchen Bridge from the South elevation [@nicholson1977].](img/Nicholson-and-Robertson-Itchen-Bridge-South-Elevation-1977.jpg){#fig-bridge-elevation fig-alt="A diagram of the Itchen Bridge from the South elevation marking the distances between piers"}

### Costs {#sec-costs}

The tender price for the bridge was £5,710,630, but in 1977 the total cost was estimated to be around £12 million [@nicholson1977]. That's approximately equivalent to a tender price of £74.5 million and total cost of £157 million in 2024 [@ukinflaa], and is about the same as it costs to run the NHS in England for 9 hours [@nhs:key].

In 1977 it was estimated that the costs would be repaid by tolls in around 25 years (2002) [@nicholson1977]. By 1981 following a question in Parliament the date for repayment was revised back to 2025 [@tollbria]. A Freedom of Information request by Victoria Fraser in September 2023 confirmed that the debt had been repaid in 2016 with toll income of between £2 and £3.8 million for the financial years 2020 to 2023 [@foi2324a]. The response to this request also noted an expected £4.5 million maintenance costs for the 2024 repairs.

The original purpose of the toll was in part as a congestion charge to discourage traffic as well as pay for the costs of the bridge and objections raised by motoring organisations almost led to the failure of the project [@robertson1976; @nicholson1977].

Approval for the project was passed in July 1973 leaving only 8 months to prepare contracts and invite tenders before the expiry of the Southampton Corporation at the end of March 1974 [@robertson1976]. The expiration of the Southampton Corporation ended the existence of the City as a Highway Authority with the power to build bridges, hence it is unclear when or if a bridge would have been built had the deadline been missed.

### Design and construction {#sec-design-and-construction}

Engineering consultancy R. Travers Morgan & Partners had been involved in the design process since 1957, initially creating designs for a prestressed concrete bridge in 1971 which became detailed designs by December 1972. The tender was awarded to Kier on 1974-02-13, just over a month before work began. @fig-gantt shows the programme for the construction [@nicholson1977].

![Itchen Bridge construction programme [@nicholson1977].](img/bridge-gantt-chart.png){#fig-gantt fig-alt="Image of the Itchen Bridge construction programme"}

The design was for a two lane road bridge with footways on either side spanning 1200 metres, originally between two roundabouts, now traffic lights at Albert Road on the western side. The carriageway is wider than was standard at 8.84 metres to allow for cyclists. Cycle lanes are now marked. Beginning on embankments, the bridge extends from two viaducts over four piers with cantilever arms connected by suspended beam spans (@fig-bridge-elevation).

Steel piles were driven 30 metres into the ground for the piers (@fig-bridge-elevation, @fig-comp-slide-02) then the piers cast upwards before the cantilever arms were built out in 3 metre sections either side of each pier for balance (@fig-complete-section). The 260 ton suspended spans were created using a special beam launcher (@fig-cantilever). Each beam took about 3 weeks to construct, launch and lower into place [@nicholson1977].

### Further history and information {#sec-further-history-and-information}

The Itchen Bridge replaced the Woolston Ferry some 144 years after a bridge was first proposed in 1833 and the history prior to the building of the bridge are well documented on the [Itchen Bridge Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itchen_Bridge) and [Woolston Floating Bridge Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolston_Floating_Bridge) pages.

Southampton Museums & Archive have a page about [the floating bridge](https://southamptonstories.co.uk/story/floating-bridge/) as part of their [Southampton Stories](https://southamptonstories.co.uk/) collection. On YouTube you can hear the song the Woolston Ferry by [Gutta Percher & Balladeers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OemLggeF8PU) which references [the Lowry painting of the ferry](https://southamptoncityartgallery.com/object/sotag-1483/) that is part of the collection at Southampton City Art Gallery.

Brian Adams wrote a book about the history and construction of the bridge (@fig-missing-link) which is available in both the Southampton City and University of Southampton Libraries [@adams1977].

![The Missing Link by Brian Adams](img/missing-link-book.png){#fig-missing-link fig-alt="Image of The Missing Link book by Brian Adams" width="296"}

For more technical details, the University of Southampton Library has two academic journal articles about the construction in its collection [@robertson1976; @nicholson1977] together with lots of other local history in the [Cope collection](https://library.soton.ac.uk/cope) and [Special Collections and Archives](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/archives/). As well as books and texts, these collections include postcards, maps and engravings.

The Daily Echo has published numerous articles about the Itchen Bridge in the last 50 years, including ['10 things you may not know'](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/24061133.10-things-may-not-know-southamptons-itchen-bridge/) and ['46 years on'](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/23559206.southampton-itchen-bridge-opened-46-years-ago-today/) and this little tidbit about [G E Prince & Sons from Chapel Road](https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/yoursay/letters/10135618.memories-of-itchen-bridge-construction/) and the origins of the Toll Booths.

The bridge also inspired Ali Sparks to write the Radio 4 drama [Tess of the Tollbooth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001tj0q).

## Colour images, then and now {#sec-colour-images-then-and-now}

The eleven 35 mm colour film slides in this sections were purchased on eBay from a seller in Kent. The slides have handwritten descriptions and dates on their casings, but the only details the seller had as to their origin was that they were taken by a photographer local to Southampton.

The slides have been colour corrected, but are otherwise unedited. They are presented in chronological order and for five of the images we were able to identify approximately where they were taken from and have taken comparison images in April 2024. To view these images without the slider, please visit the [University of Southampton Library Digital Viewer](https://viewer.soton.ac.uk/collections/itchen-bridge-project).

### 1974 {#sec-1974}

It is unclear exactly where @fig-slide-01 was taken, but the description on the slide says "Top hill at Woolston preparing for new road" and is dated 1974-08-06, nearly 5 months after the first pile was driven on 1974-03-22. We assume this is heading towards where the Toll Booths would be either on or near the Portsmouth Road (A3025).

In @fig-comp-slide-01 we see the view from the Woolston Ferry on 1974-09-16 looking east towards the construction of the bridge on the Woolston side. We can see the yellow ferry in the distance on the far shore. In 2024 the landing site of the ferry is the location of Southampton Water Activities Centre which can be seen in @fig-drone.

:::

@fig-comp-slide-02 was taken on the same day as @fig-comp-slide-01, and shows drilling for the 30 metre steel pilings for the new bridge. This location is now Oakbank Road and in 1974 Woolston Railway station could still be seen. In 2024 it is obscured by the bridge, and the old Boat Shop at the junction of Victoria Road is now The Boat Shop Cafe.

### 1975 {#sec-1975}

On 1975-03-16, almost a year after construction first began, @fig-slide-03 shows an image from Hazel Road looking west towards the Woolston Ferry landing site with a pink ice cream van on the wharf and bus nearby on what is now Wharf Road. In the river the pilings for the new bridge piers can be seen. In 2024 the view of the bridge is largely obscured by housing, but there is monument to the ferry at the entrance to the homes on Wharf Road.

:::

@fig-woolston-approach and @fig-complete-section were both taken on the same day close to Christmas on 1975-12-18.

@fig-woolston-approach shows the construction of the viaduct rising from the embankment at Portsmouth Road on the Woolston side of the bridge. A bus station appears to have existed at what is now Oakbank Road car park. On the left can be seen the cantilever from the first pier on the Woolston side.

@fig-complete-section shows a completed bridge pier and cantilever sections on the Woolston side as described in @sec-design-and-construction. This is probably the same one that can be seen on the left edge of @fig-woolston-approach.

### 1976 {#sec-1976}

There is just one photograph from 1976, taken in the spring on 1976-04-21. @fig-cantilever shows the beam launcher in action just after the construction of the suspended spans would have begun (@fig-gantt).

As described in @sec-design-and-construction, following the construction of the cantilevers from the piers, over a period of three weeks the beam launcher was used to construct and lift into place the section of bridge that is suspended between two piers and joining them.

![1976-04-21 Operation of the beam launcher to construct and install a suspend span on the Woolston side](img/Photograph-Slide-Itchen-Bridge-1976-WoolstonSideNotOver19760421small.jpg){#fig-cantilever fig-alt="1976-04-21 Woolston side"}

### 1977 {#sec-1977}

We have three photographs taken on 1977-05-31, the day that the pedestrians were first able to use the Itchen Bridge. This suggests our photographer might have been amongst them, although we have no images taken from the bridge itself. The bridge was then opened to traffic on 1977-06-01 and officially named on 1977-07-13 by Princess Alexandra.

@fig-slide-04 shows the approach to the Toll Booths on the Woolston side.
