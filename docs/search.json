    "text": "Background\n\nLocation\nThe Itchen Bridge is located on the eastern side of Southampton about a mile upstream from where the rivers Itchen and Test meet to form Southampton Water. Figure 2 shows…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Itchen bridge site in relation to the road system (Nicholson and Robertson 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\nAt 1200 metres in length and rising to provide 24.4 metres clearance at it’s highest point (28.9 metres above chart datum (“Port of Southampton,” n.d.)) and weighing in at 61,000 tons (Adams 1977), the Itchen Bridge is by far the biggest bridge in Southampton (Figure 3). The height is a result of two ship mast height surveys carried out in 1958 and 1970. Only six ships with masts greater than 24.4 metres were observed in 1970, but this was sufficient to not apply for any reduction in height as laid out in the 1960 Southampton Corporation Act. This in turn created the 5% gradient that makes the bridge rise steeply from the land on either side (Robertson 1976).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A diagram of the Itchen Bridge from the South elevation (Nicholson and Robertson 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts\nThe tender price for the bridge was £5,710,630, but in 1977 the total cost was estimated to be around £12 million (Nicholson and Robertson 1977). That’s approximately equivalent to a tender price of £74.5 million and total cost of £157 million in 2024 (“UK Inflation Calculator,” n.d.), and is about the same as it costs to run the NHS in England for 9 hours (“NHS: Key Facts And Figures,” n.d.). In 1977 it was estimated that the costs would be repaid by tolls in around 25 years (2002) (Nicholson and Robertson 1977). In 1981 following a question in Parliament the date for repayment was revised back to 2025 (“Toll Bridges, Hansard,” n.d.). A Freedom of Information request by Victoria Fraser in September 2023 confirmed that the debt had been repaid in 2016 with toll income of between £2 and £3.8 million for the financial years 2020 to 2023 (“FOI 2324 056486,” n.d.). The response to this request also noted an expected £4.5 million maintenance costs for the 2024 repairs.\nThe original purpose of the toll was in part as a congestion charge to discourage traffic as well as pay for the costs of the bridge and objections raised by motoring organisations almost led to the failure of the project (Robertson 1976; Nicholson and Robertson 1977).\n\n\nDesign and construction\nThe Itchen Bridge is a reinforced concrete structure.\n\n\nFurther history and information\nThe Itchen Bridge replaced the Woolston Ferry some 144 years after a bridge was first proposed in 1833 and the history prior to the building of the bridge are well documented on the Itchen Bridge Wikipedia and Woolston Floating Bridge Wikipedia pages.\nSouthampton Museums & Archive have a page about the floating bridge as part of their Southampton Stories collection. On YouTube you can hear the song the Woolston Ferry by Gutta Percher & Balladeers which references the Lowry painting of the ferry that is part of the collection at Southampton City Art Gallery.\nBrian Adams wrote a book about the history and construction of the bridge (Figure 4) which is available in both the Southampton City and University of Southampton Libraries (Adams 1977).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Missing Link by Brian Adams\n\n\n\nFor more technical details, the University of Southampton Library has two academic journal articles about the construction in its collection (Robertson 1976; Nicholson and Robertson 1977) together with lots of other local history in the Cope collection and Special Collections and Archives. As well as books and texts, these collections include postcards, maps and engravings.\nThe Daily Echo has published numerous articles about the Itchen Bridge in the last 50 years, including ‘10 things you may not know’ and ‘46 years on’ and this little tidbit about G E Prince & Sons from Chapel Road and the origins of the Toll Booths.\nThe bridge also inspired Ali Sparks to write the Radio 4 drama Tess of the Tollbooth."

    "text": "Colour images, then and now\nThe eleven 35 mm colour film slides in this sections were purchased on eBay from a seller in Kent. The slides have handwritten descriptions and dates on their casings, but the only details the seller had as to their origin was that they were taken by a photographer local to Southampton.\nThe slides have been colour corrected in photoshop, but otherwise are unedited. They are presented in chronlogical order and for five of the images we were able to identify approximately where they were taken from and have taken comparison images in April 2024. To view these images without the slider, please visit the University of Southampton Library Digital Viewer.\n\n1974\nIt was unclear exactly where Figure 5 was taken, but the description on the slide says “Top hill at Woolston preparing for new road” and is dated 1974-08-06, nearly 5 months after the first pile was driven on 1974-03-22. We assume this is heading towards where the Toll Booths would be either on or near the Portsmouth Road (A3025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 1974-08-06 preparing the road for the Itchen Bridge in Woolston. Location unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Figure X we see the view from the Woolston Ferry on 1974-09-16 looking east towards the construction of the bridge on the Woolston side. We can see the yellow ferry in the distance on the far shore. In 2024 the landing site of the ferry is the location of Southampton Water Activities Centre.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n    \n  \n \n\n \nFigure 5: 1974-09-16, looking east towards Woolston from the Woolston Ferry. \n \n \n\nFigure X was taken on the same day as the Figure Y, and shows pilings being driven for the new bridge. This location is now Oakbank Road and in 1974 Woolston Railway station could still be seen. In 2024 it is obscured by the bridge, and the old Boat Shop at the junction of Victoria Road is now The Boat Shop Cafe.\n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n \nFigure 6: 1974-09-16, looking east towards Woolston Railway station at piles being driven for the new bridge.  \n \n \n\n\n\n1975\nOn 1975-03-16, almost a year after construction first began we have an image from Hazel Road looking west towards the Woolston Ferry landing site with a pink ice cream van on the wharf and bus nearby on what is now Wharf Road. In the river the pilings for the new bridge piers can be seen. In 2024 the view of the bridge is largely obscured by housing, but there is monument to the ferry at the entrance to the homes on Wharf Road.\n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n \nFigure X: 1975-03-16, looking west towards the Woolston Ferry terminal in Woolston.  \n \n \n\nFigure 6 and Figure 7 were both taken on the same day close to Christmas on 1975-12-18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: 1975-12-18 Woolston Bridge approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: 1975-12-18 Itchen Bridge complete section from Woolston side\n\n\n\n\n\n1976\nThere is just one photograph from 1976, taken in the spring on 1976-04-21.
